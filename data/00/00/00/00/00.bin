  |   Three generations of Lodgers have occupied the cabin, but lately,     |
  |   the walls seem to undulate, skittering unknowns shift in the          |
  |   darkness, and an unruly growl seeps from the attic. Are they          |
  |   hallucinations pecking at the insomnia-afflicted Lodger, or the       |
  |   gnarled remnants of a darker secret?                                  |
